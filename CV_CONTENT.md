## Personal Statement

I wake up at 5am and never miss leg days. I cook for my family and make jokes they pretend to laugh at. And when none of these apply, I build AI systems that solve problems people care about. Whether it's architecting custom vision models, engineering multi-agent LLM systems, or building scalable AI backends ‚Äî I've built it, validated it, and published the research behind it.
