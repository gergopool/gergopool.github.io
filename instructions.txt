Create a personal website.

You find the content of my CV under assets/professional-readme.md. I also store my CV there as a pdf file. I also added an image of me, "gergo_grand_cny". You should imagine this as a 2048 Ã— 1536 image of the grand canyon, and I am standing in the bottom half, 3/4 of the way from the left. I can also bring a profile pic if needed.

I want the website to be responsive and mobile-friendly. The style of the website should reflect my ML engineering personality, especially the colors.

Styling:
- Colors: Make it colorful. Feel free to use some public palettes.
- Typography: Use a modern, clean, and readable font.
- Layout: Use a grid-based layout with a fixed width. Make it responsive.


I imagine the layout to be something like this:
1) On the top, there is my Grand canyon image
2) My name should show up somewhere here with large letters. With smaller letters we can write something about me.
3) The contact information (linkedin, github, email, phone, location) should be on top left, represented by clickable icons.
4) My CV should be on top right, represented by a clickable icon and the word "CV".
5) Next, below the image, we should have a summary about my skills. So technologies, charts, etc.
6) Then, experience. I beleive we should have an interactive timeline here, because we have no space to write it down everything about my experience. We should make this clickable, so a pop-up window explains more about my experience at a current workplace.
7) University education should be here.
8) Projects should be here. Similarly to my experience, we should make this clickable, so a pop-up window explains more about my project.
9) Hobbies and interests should be here.
10) Publications should be here.
11) Any other achievements should be here.
12) Contact form should be here.
